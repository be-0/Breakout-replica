Breakout is a classic arcade game developed by Atari and released in 1976. The game was inspired by the mechanics of Pong and designed to offer a single-player experience. In Breakout, the player controls a paddle that moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen. A ball bounces around the play area, and the player must use the paddle to keep the ball in play, directing it to hit and break rows of bricks at the top of the screen.

The objective is to clear all the bricks by bouncing the ball off the paddle and into them. As bricks are destroyed, the ball continues to rebound at increasingly challenging angles and speeds. If the player fails to catch the ball with the paddle and it falls off the screen, they lose a life. The game ends either when all the bricks are cleared or the player loses all their lives.

In this replica, purple bricks are unbreakable moving obstacles, while green bricks turn red after one hit on the sides and disappear after two hits on the sides or one hit on the corner. When the ball hits the paddle, it goes in a random direction.
